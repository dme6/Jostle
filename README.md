# Jostle
A recreation of PRS's new animation technique.

"Created to demonstrate a new animation technique. A grid-like mask selects every fourth pixel of a 1280x720 animation into an upscaled jiggling and jostling 640x360 animation. The mask cycles through all four sets of pixels at a rate of 15 fps." (PRS on [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/762970))

## Instructions

Simply build a jar with Maven, put frames into the "frames_in" folder, and run the program.
